# Getting help and support
{: #gettinghelp-vlans}

If you have problems or questions about using VLANs, you can get help by searching for information or by asking questions through a forum. You can also open an IBM Support case by opening the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://{DomainName}/unifiedsupport/cases/add){: external} and logging in to your account.
{: shortdesc}

If you use the forum to ask a question, tag your question so that it is seen by the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} development teams.

For more information about opening an IBM Support case, or about support levels and case severities, see [Contacting support](/docs/get-support).
