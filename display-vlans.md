## Tagging VLANs
{: #tagging-vlans}

You can tag all VLANs on your account with one or more alphanumeric identifiers to make it easier to search for and select specific VLANs. Use custom tags to locate VLANs on your account rather than information such as the fully qualified name, data center, or pod. Follow these steps to create or update VLAN tags.

1. Click the **Add tags** button at the top of the **VLAN Details** page. If one or more tags are already present on the VLAN, click the pencil icon to update them.
1. In the **Update tags** window that appears, enter one or more tags to be created or remove existing tags by clicking the `x` on the tag.
1. Click **Save** to update the tags.
