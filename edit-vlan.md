# Editing a VLAN name
{: #edit-vlan-name}
{: help}
{: support}

Each VLAN has a fully qualified name to help identify it. You also can add a custom name and edit it at any time.
{: shortdesc}

VLAN names are displayed on the **VLANs** page and also when you view an individual VLAN. It is recommended that you use a naming convention for your VLANs, so they can be identified easily by all users on the account.

You can update the VLAN name from the **VLANs** page or from the **VLAN Details** page. Your changes are visible in all locations for the VLAN, regardless of which option you use.

For either option, follow these steps first to go to the **VLANs** page.

1. From your browser, open the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://{DomainName}/){: external} and log in to your account. 
1. From the console, click the Menu icon ![menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) and select **Classic Infrastructure**. 
1. Select **Network > IP Management > VLANs**.


To add or edit a VLAN name from the **VLANs** page:

1. Click the overflow menu ![overflow icon](/images/overflow.png) for the VLAN you want to edit and select **Rename**.
1. Add a new name or edit an existing name.
1. Click **Update** to save the name.

   A name can have a maximum of 20 characters. 
   {: note}


To edit a name from the **VLAN Details** page:

1. Click **Edit** in the upper right corner of the **Details** section.
