# Editing a VLAN name
{: #edit-vlan-name}
{: help}
{: support}

Each VLAN has a fully qualified name to help identify it. You also can add a custom name and edit it at any time.
{: shortdesc}

VLAN names are displayed on the VLANs page and also when you view an individual VLAN. It is recommended that you use a naming convention for your VLANs, so they can be identified easily by all users on the account.

You can update the VLAN name from the VLANs page or from the VLAN Details page. Your changes are visible in all locations for the VLAN, regardless of which option you use.

For either option, follow these steps first to go to the VLANs page.

1. From your browser, open the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://{DomainName}/){: external} and log in to your account. 
1. From the console, click the Menu icon ![menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) and select **Classic Infrastructure**. 
1. Select **Network > IP Management > VLANs**.

To add or edit a VLAN name from the VLANs page:

1. Select **Rename** from the overflow menu ![overflow icon](/images/overflow.png) for the specific VLAN that you want to edit.
1. Add a name or edit one, then click **Update**.

   A name can have a maximum of 20 characters. 
   {: note}

To edit a name from the VLAN Details page:

1. Click the fully qualified name of a VLAN to view its details.
1. Click **Edit** in the upper right of the page.
