# Ordering premium VLANs
{: #ordering-premium-vlans}
{: help}
{: support}

When you're ready to explore a more complex network topology, you can add more VLANs to isolate traffic between groups of devices. Unlike Automatic VLANs, which are automatically assigned to fulfill the needs of other products, a Premium VLAN stays on your account until canceled.

## What happens next
{: #order-premium-vlans-what-happens-next}

A new VLAN with your specific configuration appears on your account within a few moments, except in cases that require approval processes for your account status.

New VLANs are typically delivered without a Primary Subnet. The existence of one is not an indication that it will be added in the future. To understand more about what Primary Subnets are and how to use them, review [Subnets and IPs](/docs/subnets?topic=subnets-getting-started).
