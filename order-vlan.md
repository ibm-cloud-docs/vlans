# Ordering a Premium VLAN
{: #ordering-premium-vlans}
{: help}
{: support}

When you're ready to explore a more complex network topology, you can add more VLANs to isolate traffic between groups of devices. Unlike Automatic VLANs, which are automatically assigned to fulfill the needs of other products, a Premium VLAN stays on your account until canceled.

Follow these steps to order a Premium VLAN:

1. From your browser, open the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://{DomainName}/){: external} and log in to your account.
1. From the console, click the Menu icon ![menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) and select **Classic Infrastructure**. 
1. In the navigation pane, select **Network > IP Management > VLANs**.
1. Select **Order** and complete your specific configuration. 

## What happens next
{: #order-premium-vlans-what-happens-next}

A new VLAN with your specific configuration appears on your account within a few moments, except in cases that require approval processes for your account status.

New Premium VLANs are typically delivered without a primary subnet. The absence of a primary subnet is not an indication that one won't be added in the future. To understand more about what primary subnets are and how to use them, review [Subnets and IPs](/docs/subnets?topic=subnets-getting-started).
